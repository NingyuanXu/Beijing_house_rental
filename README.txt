This project uses Python request, BeaufifulSoup, and Javascript API to solve house-rental problem in Beijing, by using python script to request housing informatio from 58 同城 in China. I also use GaoDe JsAPI to mark housing locations on map, and mark areas which could be reached from the destinatio within one hour. The purpose of developing this app is to provide young people a better platform to find houses to live in.

Most Javascript API comes from GaoDe API, which is an open free source for developers.
